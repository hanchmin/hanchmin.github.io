I am Postdoc Researcher at [Center for Innovation in Data Engineering and Science (IDEAS)](https://ideas.seas.upenn.edu/), University of Pennsylvania, advised by [Prof. René Vidal](http://vision.jhu.edu/rvidal.html). My research centers around building mathematical principles that facilitates the interplay between machine learning and dynamical systems. Recently, I am mainly interested in analyzing gradient-based optimization algorithms on overparametrized neural networks from a dynamical system perspective. 

Prior to entering Penn, I received Ph.D. degree from Johns Hopkins University, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Enrique Mallada](http://mallada.ece.jhu.edu) and [Prof. René Vidal](http://vision.jhu.edu/rvidal.html). Before Hopkins, I received Master’s degree in Systems Engineering from University of Pennsylvannia and Bachelor’s degree in Automation from Tongji Univerisity, Shanghai.
