I am Postdoc Researcher at [Center for Innovation in Data Engineering and Science (IDEAS)](https://ideas.seas.upenn.edu/), University of Pennsylvania, advised by [Prof. René Vidal](http://vision.jhu.edu/rvidal.html). My research centers around building mathematical principles that facilitates the interplay between machine learning and dynamical systems, which combines tools in high dimensional probability, graph theory, dynamical system, control, and optimization.

Specifically, I am interested in utilizing data-driven methods to understand the dynamical behavior of large-scale and networked systems, as well as using learning-based control design for improving the performance of these systems while maintaining safe operation. In addition, I work on analyzing optimization algorithms in machine learning from a dynamical system point of view. 

Prior to entering Penn, I received Ph.D. degree from Johns Hopkins University, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Enrique Mallada](http://mallada.ece.jhu.edu) and [Prof. René Vidal](http://vision.jhu.edu/rvidal.html). Before Hopkins, I received Master’s degree in Systems Engineering from University of Pennsylvannia and Bachelor’s degree in Automation from Tongji Univerisity, Shanghai.
